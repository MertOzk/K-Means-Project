# K-Means-Project

To be able to view this project you will need Python, Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda installed. You can click on the hyperlinks to look at a guide on how to install them. Please install the workbook and the dataset and change your directory to the downloaded folder to successfully run the workbook.

I will use a data frame with 777 observations and 18 variables, which you can see below.The dataset is on Universities and my goal will be to split the data into two groups private and public. I have the labels for the datasets which I naturally will not use in the unsupervised model. Since this is a project I wanted to compare my model's output with the actual labels to see how my model performed.

* Private A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university
* Apps Number of applications received
* Accept Number of applications accepted
